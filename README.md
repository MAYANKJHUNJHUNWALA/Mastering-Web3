# README 
I have written this program using the java coding language where I used the attributes and methods provided to me in the task and then I also created a sample of collision of cars using some sample data to test the program, I even used a constructor in my java program and made all the attributes private to be accessed in the program in the class . I have shared the link of this github repository in the google doc as instructed in the readme format.
I have used this keyword to initialise variables inside the constructor.
I have also created some getters which will return the respective values whenever called somewhere in the program.
I have made time to collision infinity if their relative speed is negative.
I have used Math library of java to call absolute function Math.abs to perform time calculations.
At last, I have tested my program using four different cars where i called different detect_collision and time_to_collide respectively.
